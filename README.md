# Music App

My original intent here was to have an app that would be an aid to a practicing musician.  The app
would track timing and pitch, and tell you when you messed up (for me, that would be particularly
helpful with pitch, as I have a hard time telling if I'm a little sharp or flat while I'm
practicing my flute).  I got a prototype working, then ran into some significant hurdles and moved
on to something else.  The biggest issue I faced was rendering music - I couldn't find any library
that looked decent for rendering simple music.  I also don't have a lot of expertise in sound
processing, so my note transcription code isn't amazing.  But it seems like the current
transcription software I've seen is only aimed at finding the note a person was _trying_ to play,
not their exact timing and pitch, so I'm not sure I can just use some off-the-shelf code for this
task, anyway.
